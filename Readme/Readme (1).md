# üé¨ Pickflix ! üçø

Alright folks, buckle up and join me on a very cool journey that combines the magical world of movies with some data analysis superpower.

From a suspenseful thriller to a heartwarming romance, we got you covered! This is end of the endless scrolling on your streaming apps while watchng your meal get cold.
My baby (yes I am very proud) not only suggests similar movies based on a chosen movie title, but also based on an actor/actress or a genre you might fancy. 

Altough some machine learning was used, I promise that no machine were harmes in the process.. I'm sure you also vividly remember iRobotüòâ!

# Get This Show on the Road! üõ£Ô∏è

Some basic steps to get your local machine up and running with our system.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Installing

Install Python 

Install the following libaries : 
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn streamlit

2Ô∏è‚É£ Running my project

Navigate to your project folder in the terminal to launch the Streamlit interface
- streamlit run app2.py

3Ô∏è‚É£Using the recommender

My main thing is a function called recommend_movies, with the name of a movie in parenthesis
Give it a movie title and voila, you get a list of 5 movies that you'll most probably love!

- You can test it like that : 

recommendations = recommend_movies("Spider-Man: The Hunt")

print(recommendations)

As well, as the code for a Streamlit interface, I have a notebook for recommendations based on actors/actresses and genres.
You will also find some SQL Queries and some vizualisations.

# üéûÔ∏è Data & Tools used to handle it

- The data was taken from our lord and savior, IMDb. 

As for the tools, we have:

- Python 3 - The magic language
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn - Not the cast of Kung-Fu Panda but just as fun
- Streamlit - The magic carpet you can find in Aladdin, that will take you to our system so you can interact
